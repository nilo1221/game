# Shattered Vale

A top-down action RPG built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas — no engine, no build step, no dependencies. Explore a village, talk to NPCs, find a hidden sword, battle slimes, and defeat the goblin chief to save the village.

## Playing

No installation or server required — just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy

### 1. Static game (Vercel)

The front-end is pure static files and is ready for Vercel:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Login and deploy
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

Or connect this Git repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and it will auto-deploy on every push to `main`.

### 2. Multiplayer (PartyKit)

Il multiplayer usa [PartyKit](https://partykit.io) (free tier su Cloudflare):

```bash
# Sviluppo locale
npm run dev

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

Il client si connette all'URL in `js/config/balance.js`:

```js
const WS_SERVER = 'https://shattered-vale-mp.nilo1221.partykit.dev';
```

Lascia `WS_SERVER = ''` per giocare offline.

### 3. Cloud save with Appwrite (free)

The game can persist gold, gems, honor and player name on Appwrite Cloud's free tier. The client is implemented with plain `fetch` calls (`js/services/appwrite-client.js`) so no bundler or SDK is required.

1. Create a free account on [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io).
2. Create a new project and add a **Web platform** with your Vercel domain (`*.vercel.app` or your custom domain).
3. Inside the project create a database and a collection named `players`.
4. In that collection create one attribute:
   - **Key:** `data`
   - **Type:** `string`
   - **Size:** `1000000` (1 MB)
5. Set the collection permissions so authenticated users can create/read/update their own documents, or give broad `users` create/read/update permissions for a prototype.
6. Copy the project ID, database ID and collection ID into `js/config/appwrite.js`:

```js
const APPWRITE_PROJECT = 'your-project-id';
const APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = 'your-database-id';
const APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID = 'your-collection-id';
```

Leave `APPWRITE_PROJECT` empty to keep cloud save disabled and use `localStorage` only.

## How to play

1. Explore the village and find **Elder Rowan** — talk to him (`E`) to start the quest.
2. Visit the **Wandering Merchant** for a free health potion.
3. Head west to the castle and pick up the **Iron Sword** lying in the grass.
4. Fight **slimes** scattered around the map for gold and XP; leveling up increases your max HP and attack.
5. Head to the castle and defeat the **Goblin King Grimtooth** to open a New Worlds.

Your HP, level/XP, and gold are tracked in the HUD above the game canvas. If your HP reaches 0, refresh the page to try again.

## Features

- **Procedurally drawn sprites** — layered, directional character sheets (no external image assets) for the player, elder, merchant, all slime variants, the spider, the skeleton, and all five bosses (Goblin King, Devil, Orc Warlord, Jungle Witch, Skeleton King), each with walk-cycle animation
- **Textured world spanning four zones** — starting village/forest, beach oasis, jungle, and a skeleton dungeon — with autotile edge-blending between grass/path/sand/water/jungle/crypt floor, a bridge, animated water shimmer, and scattered zone-specific decoration (flowers, rocks, tall grass, shells, ferns, vines, bones, braziers)
- **Depth-sorted rendering** so characters and items visually overlap correctly based on their position
- **Combat system** with melee hitboxes, ranged fireball projectiles, telegraphed enemy attacks, hit-flash feedback, and per-enemy HP bars
- **Boss encounters** with a dedicated health banner, low-HP warning pulse, and unique defeat drops/cutscenes for each of the five bosses
- **Gated progression** — defeating guardian enemies or specific bosses opens new gates (village → oasis → jungle → dungeon), tracked by a simple quest stage
- **Leveling system** — gaining XP raises level, max HP, and attack; mana regenerates over time to fuel fireballs
- **Particle effects** — hit bursts, floating damage/XP/gold numbers, footstep sparkles, camera shake, and full-screen flash on level-up, boss kills, and gate openings
- **Typewriter-style dialogue box** with one-time quest/gift conversations (Elder Rowan, the Wandering Merchant) and short "System" narration cutscenes after boss fights
- **Full inventory system** — an equip-slot panel (helmet/weapon/armor/shield/boots) alongside a backpack grid, with click-to-equip/unequip and consumable potions (health/mana)
- **Smooth camera** that follows the player and clamps to the map bounds
- **Start menu, how-to-play panel, and game-over/restart screen**, plus a desktop-only block screen for mobile visitors (this game requires a keyboard)

## Customizing

A few starting points if you want to extend it:

- **Add an enemy type** — add a new palette/sprite builder in `sprites.js`, then instantiate it via `new Enemy(x, y, 'yourType')` in `game.js`. Enemy stats (HP, speed, damage) are set in the `Enemy` constructor in `entities.js`.
- **Expand the map** — edit `TileMap` in `tilemap.js`; increase the `cols`/`rows` passed into `new TileMap(...)` in `game.js` and add new features inside `_buildWorld()`.
- **Add dialogue/NPCs** — create a new `NPC(...)` in `game.js` with a `dialogue` array of strings; push it into the `npcs` array.
- **Add items** — draw a new icon function in `sprites.js`, register it in `Sprites.icons`, then place a `new WorldItem(x, y, 'yourKind')` in `game.js`.

## Browser support

Any modern browser with Canvas2D support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No mobile touch controls are implemented — keyboard required.
